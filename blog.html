                <p>Corporate law (also known as business law or enterprise law or sometimes company law) is the body of law governing the rights, relations, and conduct of persons, companies, organizations and businesses. The term refers to the legal practice of law relating to corporations, or to the theory of corporations. Corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly from the life-cycle of a corporation. It thus encompasses the formation, funding, governance, and death of a corporation.

                    While the minute nature of corporate governance as personified by share ownership, capital market, and business culture rules differ, similar legal characteristics - and legal problems - exist across many jurisdictions. Corporate law regulates how corporations, investors, shareholders, directors, employees, creditors, and other stakeholders such as consumers, the community, and the environment interact with one another.</p><p>Whilst the term company or business law is colloquially used interchangeably with corporate law. While business law mostly refers to wider concepts of commercial law , that is the law relating to commercial and business related purposes and activities. In some cases, this may include matters relating to corporate governance or financial law. When used as a substitute for corporate law, business law means the law relating to the business corporation (or business enterprises), including such activity as raising capital, company formation, and registration with the government.</p>

                        <h1>Criminal Laws</h1>
                        <p> Criminal law refers to a body of laws that apply to criminal acts. In instances where an individual fails to adhere to a particular criminal statute, he or she commits a criminal act by breaking the law. This body of laws is different from civil law, because criminal law penalties involve the forfeiture of one's rights and imprisonment. Conversely, civil laws relate to the resolution of legal controversies and involve money damages. </p>  
                            <p>  
                    There are various theories for why we have a criminal law system. Neither theory is exclusive or dispositive. The main theories for criminal law include: to deter crime, to reform the perpetrator, to provide retribution for the act, and to prevent further crimes. There is much discussion regarding these theories of criminal law and which policy is best promoted by the body of criminal law.
                        </p>

                   <b>Types of Criminal Laws </b> <br>
                    
                   <b> There are two types of criminal laws: </b> <li> <b> Misdemeanor: </b> </li>
                    <p>A misdemeanor is an offense that is considered a lower level criminal offense, such as minor assaults, traffic offenses, or petty thefts. Moreover, in most states, the penalty for the misdemeanor crime is typically one year or less.</p>
                     <li>   <b> Felony: </b> </li>
                     <p>In contrast, felony crimes involve more serious offenses. Some examples of felonies include murder, manslaughter, dealing drugs, rape, robbery, and arson. In virtually every state in the U.S., felonies carry a penalty of one year or more, depending upon the particular nature of the offense and the jurisdiction where the felony crime was committed. In addition, every state has a different body of criminal laws which vary from state to state. There are also federal criminal law statutes which apply to every state in the U.S.</p>
                                
                    <ul> <b> Parts of Criminal Law Statutes : </b> </ul>
                    
                        <li>All criminal law statutes contain two distinct parts. The first of these parts is the mens rea, which is the mental state that one must possess when committing a crime. For example, if one commits murder, it is necessary that the party committing the murder intended to engage in the act. This intention is the mens rea of the crime of murder.
                        </li>
                        <li>The other part of a criminal statute is the actus reus. This portion of the criminal statute refers to the action taken by the perpetrator. For instance, in a drug dealing case, in order to charge the perpetrator with the crime of drug dealing, the perpetrator must have actually sold the drugs. This is the action required for criminal's status's actus resus to exist
                        </li>
